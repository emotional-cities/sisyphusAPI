Areas with greater disadvantage are ranked higher. National scores are normalized to the whole country, and state scores are normalized to a particular state. Higher Area Deprivation Index scores have been shown to correlate with worse health outcomes in measures such as life expectancy. This index was created by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison based on a methodology originally developed by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Areas on this map are ranked against other areas within the state. State scores represent deciles.
